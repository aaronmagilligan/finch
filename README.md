# finch
A statistical fitting program to constrain nuclear shell model interactions with experimental data, and provide uncertainty quantification for model parameters and predictions.

finch.py contains the python code to perform the fit through calling legacy Fortran code (not included in this repo, contact brown@frib.msu.edu to request NuShellX)

Explanation of other files and instructions for use can be found in the help-finch.pdf
